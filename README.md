# DataLoader
tool to automate the loading of data into the ResourceManager Database

this tool was built to transfer data exported from Ajera to the ResourceManagement Database. 
this process was needed as acess to the Ajera database is restricted. 
the ResourceManager is dependent on employee and project information, both of which are stored within Ajera.
